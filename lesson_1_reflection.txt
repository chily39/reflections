How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was easier to see only the differences between two files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Identify mistakes quickly and less prone to break code affecting many others

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros on manual: You control what will be added and saved; Cons - Your work might lost
    Pros on automatic: You don't need to too worry about your work being lost Cons: Unnecessary items gets saved

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Since programming involves multiple files to change your change should includes all you have changed. Writing document usually involves affecting only one file(your file) so treat only one file makes organization easier

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I need to learn this later

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can always revert back to previous working state so less worry about fixing my bugs

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Add my programmng changes
